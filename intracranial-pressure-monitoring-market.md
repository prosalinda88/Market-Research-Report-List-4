<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial pressure monitoring involves the measurement of pressure inside the skull to assess brain health. There are two main types of monitoring methods: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive methods require inserting a probe directly into the brain, providing more accurate readings but carrying a higher risk of infection. Non-invasive methods, such as using external devices to measure pressure through the skull, are safer but may be less precise. Both types of monitoring are valuable tools in diagnosing and managing conditions affecting intracranial pressure.</p></p>
