<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adiabatic Coolers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Air Cooler</li><li>Liquid Cooler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Adiabatic coolers are devices used to cool a fluid without the use of an external heat source. There are two main types of adiabatic coolers: dry air coolers and liquid coolers. Dry air coolers work by using ambient air to remove heat from the fluid, while liquid coolers use a liquid to transfer the heat away. Both types of coolers are commonly used in industrial applications to maintain optimal operating temperatures for equipment and machinery.</p></p>
