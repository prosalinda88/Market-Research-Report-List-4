<p><ul><li>Abrasive Blades</li><li>Diamond Blades</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Handheld concrete saws are classified into two main types based on the blades they use: abrasive blades and diamond blades. Abrasive blades are made of a composite material with particles of abrasive materials like silicon carbide or aluminum oxide embedded in them. They are more affordable but wear out quickly. Diamond blades, on the other hand, have diamond particles embedded in them, making them more durable and suitable for cutting hard materials like concrete. While diamond blades are more expensive, they provide better performance and longer lifespan.</p></p>
