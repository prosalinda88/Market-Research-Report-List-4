<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lazy Eye Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Strabismic</li><li>Refractive Amblyopia</li><li>Deprivation Amblyopia</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lazy eye, also known as amblyopia, can be categorized into three main market types based on the underlying cause: strabismic amblyopia, refractive amblyopia, and deprivation amblyopia. Strabismic amblyopia occurs when there is a misalignment of the eyes, causing the brain to ignore visual input from one eye. Refractive amblyopia is caused by a significant difference in refractive error between the eyes, leading to one eye being weaker than the other. Deprivation amblyopia occurs when there is a physical obstruction or blockage of vision in one eye, preventing normal visual development. Each market type requires different treatment approaches to improve vision and prevent long-term vision impairment.</p></p>
