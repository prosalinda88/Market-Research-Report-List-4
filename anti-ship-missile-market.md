<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-ship Missile Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid-fueled</li><li>Turbojet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-ship missile market consists of two main types: solid-fueled missiles and turbojet missiles. Solid-fueled missiles use a solid propellant to generate thrust, providing a simpler and more reliable propulsion system. They are often more cost-effective and have a longer shelf life compared to liquid-fueled missiles. On the other hand, turbojet missiles use an air-breathing engine for propulsion, allowing for higher speeds and longer ranges. These missiles are typically more maneuverable and versatile in various combat scenarios.</p></p>
