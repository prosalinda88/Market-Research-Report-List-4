<p><strong>The Novel Oral Anticoagulants Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Thrombin Inhibitor</li><li>Factor Xa Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) drugs are a newer class of medications that inhibit the clotting process to prevent blood clots. There are two main types of NOACs: direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors. Direct thrombin inhibitors target a specific clotting factor called thrombin, while factor Xa inhibitors target factor Xa, another important clotting factor. Both types of NOACs are used to prevent conditions such as stroke and deep vein thrombosis. They offer advantages over traditional anticoagulants, such as easier dosing and monitoring.</p></p>
