<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cathodic Protection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Galvanic</li><li>Impressed Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cathodic Protection Systems include two main types - Galvanic and Impressed Current. Galvanic systems use sacrificial anodes to protect the structure from corrosion, while Impressed Current systems use an external power source to generate the protective current. The Galvanic system is often preferred for smaller-scale applications due to its simplicity and lower cost, while the Impressed Current system is more commonly used for larger structures or where a higher level of control is required. Both systems are essential in preventing corrosion and ensuring the longevity of metal structures.</p></p>
