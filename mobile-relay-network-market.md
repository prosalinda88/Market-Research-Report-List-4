<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile Relay Network Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infrastructure Less</li><li>Infrastructure Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A Mobile Relay Network can be classified into two main types: Infrastructure Less and Infrastructure Based. In an Infrastructure Less network, devices communicate directly with each other without the need for a centralized base station. This type of network is useful in remote or ad-hoc situations where traditional infrastructure is not available. On the other hand, an Infrastructure Based network relies on a centralized base station for communication between devices. This type of network is more common in urban areas where existing infrastructure can be utilized for efficient communication.</p></p>
