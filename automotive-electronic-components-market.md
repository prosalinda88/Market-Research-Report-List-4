<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Electronic Components Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Components</li><li>Passive Components</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Electronic Components market consists of two major types: Active Components and Passive Components. Active Components include devices that require an external power source to function, such as transistors and integrated circuits. These components actively control the flow of current within the circuit. Passive Components, on the other hand, do not require an external power source and include components like resistors and capacitors. They primarily store or dissipate energy within the circuit and do not control current flow. Both types play crucial roles in the functioning of automotive electronic systems.</p></p>
