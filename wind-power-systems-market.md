<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Power Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid</li><li>Off-Grid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wind power systems can be categorized into two main market types: On-Grid and Off-Grid. On-Grid systems are connected to the main electricity grid and provide power directly to homes and businesses. This type of system allows for excess power to be sold back to the grid. Off-Grid systems, on the other hand, operate independently of the main electricity grid and are typically used in remote locations where grid connection is not practical. These systems rely on batteries to store excess power for use when wind speeds are low.</p></p>
