<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dynamic Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Seal</li><li>Non-contact Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dynamic Seals market can be divided into two main types: contact seals and non-contact seals. Contact seals rely on physical contact between the seal and the mating surface to prevent leakage, providing a higher level of sealing effectiveness but also creating more friction and wear. On the other hand, non-contact seals operate without physical contact, using barriers like air or magnetic fields to prevent leakage. While non-contact seals offer lower friction and longer lifespan, they may not provide the same level of sealing effectiveness as contact seals.</p></p>
