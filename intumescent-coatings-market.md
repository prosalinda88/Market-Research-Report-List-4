<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intumescent Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cellulose</li><li>Hydrocarbon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intumescent coatings are fire-resistant coatings that swell and expand when exposed to heat, providing protection against fire. There are two main types of intumescent coatings on the market: Cellulose-based and Hydrocarbon-based. Cellulose-based coatings are derived from natural fibers such as wood or cotton, while Hydrocarbon-based coatings are made from synthetic materials like polymers. Both types work by creating a barrier that insulates the surface from high temperatures and prevents the spread of fire.</p></p>
