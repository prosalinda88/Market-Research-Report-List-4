<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Endoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fiberscopes</li><li>Rigid Borescopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial endoscopes are used in various industries for remote visual inspection of inaccessible or hazardous areas. Two common types of industrial endoscopes are fiberscopes and rigid borescopes. Fiberscopes use fiber optic technology to transmit images back to the user, allowing for flexible navigation through small spaces. Rigid borescopes are straight tubes with a lens at the end, providing a more direct and stable view of the inspection area. Both types offer unique benefits and are used in different applications based on their design and capabilities.</p></p>
