<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Troponin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laboratory Testing</li><li>Point-of-care Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Troponin testing can be categorized into two main markets: Laboratory Testing and Point-of-care Testing. Laboratory testing involves sending samples to a central lab for analysis, which allows for more detailed results but may take longer to receive. Point-of-care testing, on the other hand, enables quicker results at the patient's bedside or in other clinical settings, making it ideal for emergency situations. These different markets cater to the varying needs of healthcare providers for efficient and accurate cardiac troponin testing.</p></p>
