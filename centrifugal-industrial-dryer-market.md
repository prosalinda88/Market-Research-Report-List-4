<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Industrial Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct</li><li>Indirect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal industrial dryers can be categorized into two main types: direct and indirect dryers. Direct dryers operate by heating the material directly with hot air, while indirect dryers heat a separate heat exchanger and transfer the heat to the material through a rotating drum. Direct dryers are typically more energy efficient and faster, while indirect dryers are better suited for sensitive materials or when the drying process needs to be more controlled. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various industrial applications.</p></p>
