<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radial Forging Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Forging</li><li>Cold Forging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial forging machines are used in both hot forging and cold forging processes. Hot forging involves heating the material until it is malleable and then shaping it through compression using a radial forging machine. This process is typically used for creating complex shapes and precision components. In contrast, cold forging does not involve heating the material, but instead relies on the force applied by the machine to shape the material. Cold forging is often used for creating high-strength components with improved mechanical properties.</p></p>
