<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thrombosis Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>P2Y12 Platelet Inhibitor</li><li>Xa Inhibitor</li><li>Heparin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Thrombosis Drug market consists of three main types of drugs: P2Y12 Platelet Inhibitors, Xa Inhibitors, and Heparin. P2Y12 Platelet Inhibitors work by preventing blood clots from forming by targeting a specific receptor on platelets. Xa Inhibitors block the activity of factor Xa, a key protein in the blood clotting process. Heparin, a type of anticoagulant, works by enhancing the activity of antithrombin, a protein that inhibits blood clot formation. These drugs are essential in preventing and treating thrombosis-related conditions.</p></p>
