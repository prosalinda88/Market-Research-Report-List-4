<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cryoablation Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Point</li><li>Multielectrode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cryoablation catheters come in two main types: single point and multielectrode. Single point catheters are designed with one freezing tip that creates extreme cold temperatures to ablate tissue. On the other hand, multielectrode catheters have multiple freezing tips which allow for a larger area of tissue to be treated simultaneously. Both types of catheters are used in cryoablation procedures to target and destroy abnormal tissues, such as tumors, in various medical applications.</p></p>
