<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Pressure Nitrogen Booster Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil Compressor</li><li>Oil-free Compressor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Pressure Nitrogen Booster Compressors are available in two main types: Oil Compressors and Oil-free Compressors. Oil compressors use oil lubrication to reduce friction and wear on moving parts, making them more durable but requiring regular maintenance. Oil-free compressors, on the other hand, do not require oil lubrication due to special coatings or materials on the internal components, making them more environmentally friendly and suitable for applications where oil contamination is a concern.</p></p>
