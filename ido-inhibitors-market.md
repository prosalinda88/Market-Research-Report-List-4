<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IDO Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual IDO1/TDO inhibitors</li><li>Covalent IDO inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>IDO inhibitors are a type of immunotherapy drug used to block the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in cancer cells, which helps the cancer cells evade the immune system. There are different types of IDO inhibitors, including dual IDO1/TDO inhibitors that target both IDO and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) enzymes, as well as covalent IDO inhibitors that form a strong chemical bond with the enzyme to block its activity more effectively. These inhibitors show promise in enhancing the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy treatments.</p></p>
